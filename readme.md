Name- Khurt Ledesma
Overview- I created a website for a fake bouldering gym.
Details- the site is a simple 4 page site: Home/FAW and Rates/ Application and Gallery. All sites are accessible using the navbar on the top of the page.
Tech Used - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JQuery
Future Improvement - 
1. Would like to create a more in depth form that updates as you fill it out
2. Would like to use more javascript to have elements in the page be more dynamic, for example have sections slide into the page when you scroll down 
3. Create a more unique navbar
